# hashing

### Map ADT
* a map is a collection of key-value pairs
* keys are unique, values might not be
* two operations:
  * put() - insert a key-value pair
  * get() - find the value associated with a key

* store(key, value) pairs in a set
  * e.g. store them in an AVL tree, with the comparator comparing keys (O(logn))

* use an array of values
  * only integers can be used as keys (the array might need to be large) (O(1))
* use has tables
    * an extesion of the array idea, but without needing very large arrays
